# Instructions

## Purpose
For this program and because I play a lot minecraft I decided to create a program that can help me to manage the backups of my worlds of minecraft.
<br>
This is because sometimes I want to do specific things with that worlds so more functions will be added with the time according to what I need to do with the worlds

## Intallation, libraries and considerations
* For its correct installation and use you need first python3 the version 3 or higher.
* The program can be executed in Windows, Linux and Mac operative systems.
* The libraries used until now are libraries that python has by default.

## Execution of the program
After all previous considerations are done in order to run the program you need to write in the terminal the next command:
* If you´re in Windows: python ScrapingMain.py
* If you´re in Linux: python3 ScrapingMain.py
* If you´re in Mac: python ScrapingMain.py
<br>
NOTE: The above commands are for running the program only if you have python installed in your computer using your environment variables.
<br>
If you´re using something like Anaconda or other programs you will need to run thje program maybe in a different way/method.

# The following functionality will be added.
* A menu in order to use the another functions.
* The menu will show options like moving the file from downloads to the target path
* Will create other local backups
